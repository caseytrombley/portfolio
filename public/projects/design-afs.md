## Designing & Developing AFS

Accelerated Financial Services (AFS) needed a strong, professional brand identity along with a modern, user-friendly website to support their clients. I worked closely with their team to establish a visual style that reflects trust, expertise, and financial growth.

### Branding & Design

- Developed a sleek, corporate identity with a modern logo and color palette.
- Created a consistent brand language for web and print materials.
- Ensured accessibility and clarity in typography and UI elements.

### Website & Blog Development

- Designed and built a responsive website using Vue.js for an interactive, dynamic experience.
- Integrated a blog for financial insights, optimized for SEO and easy content management.
- Implemented performance enhancements to ensure fast load times and smooth navigation.

AFS now has a strong digital presence that reflects their industry leadership and credibility.
