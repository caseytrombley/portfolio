## Advertising - Web & Print Design for Advertisers, Artists, and Musicians

Throughout my career, I’ve designed ads, logos, websites, and promotional materials for a wide range of clients. A notable part of my experience involved working for a dozen radio stations under the former ClearChannel umbrella (now iHeartRadio). During this time, I created various promotional and marketing materials that resonated with their diverse audiences, from digital banners to print ads.

- Crafted promotional content for radio station events, new show launches, and artist promotions, ensuring that each campaign's design matched the station's unique brand.
- Specialized in creating visually compelling and engaging designs that attracted attention, encouraged action, and boosted listener engagement.

### Logo Design & Branding

- Worked on logo design and brand identity development for radio stations, advertisers, and music-related businesses, helping to establish their presence in the market.
- Designed logos and brand materials that encapsulated each station’s distinct style and personality, from classic and timeless to modern and edgy.
- Ensured consistency across all marketing materials, creating a unified identity for each station and client.

### Ads for Radio Stations & Digital Media

- Designed both digital and print ads for promotional campaigns, station events, and local advertisers, working closely with clients to bring their vision to life.
- Focused on creating effective ad layouts, catchy graphics, and persuasive calls to action that resulted in increased brand recognition and audience interaction.
- Used a deep understanding of radio station audiences and their preferences to tailor ads for maximum impact.

### Promotional Materials for Artists & Musicians

- Created promotional materials for artists, musicians, and events, including album covers, concert posters, and social media visuals, helping to build awareness and promote their work.
- Designed album art, event flyers, and social media graphics that helped musicians connect with their audiences and expand their fan base.
- Worked closely with marketing teams to develop campaigns that effectively promoted new releases and tours, from graphic design to digital content.

### Advanced Typography & Layout

- Mastered typography and layout design, focusing on how text and visual elements could work together to enhance readability and evoke the right emotion.
- Developed designs with a clear hierarchy, ensuring that messaging and calls to action were prominent and easy to follow.
- Worked with both traditional and digital typography, using advanced techniques to bring balance and clarity to all designs.

### Experience with Both Print and Digital Media

- Skilled in adapting designs for both print and digital platforms, ensuring they met the technical requirements of each.
- Familiar with designing for the specific needs of radio station advertising (audio-visual elements, event-driven campaigns, etc.) and digital media formats (web, social media, email newsletters).

My work for iHeartRadio (formerly ClearChannel) gave me invaluable experience designing for the entertainment and advertising industries. I developed a deep understanding of branding, digital and print design, and how to create compelling content that resonates with diverse audiences. My expertise spans from creating logos and ads to full-scale website designs, and I continue to leverage my skills to deliver exceptional work for my clients.
