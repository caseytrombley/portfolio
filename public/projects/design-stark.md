## Stark Equipment - Early Storefront Design & Development

One of my earlier projects was designing and developing the website for **Stark Equipment**, a company specializing in industrial equipment sales. This was a foundational project for me, as it helped me hone my skills in web design and development, while also teaching me how to interpret client needs and vision into a functional and visually engaging website.

### Design & Development Process

From the outset, the owner of Stark Equipment had a clear vision of what he wanted for the site: a professional, user-friendly storefront that showcased their product offerings while making it easy for customers to browse and make inquiries. It was a simple yet effective design, and I was thrilled to take it on.

- **Client Collaboration**: I love meeting with clients to discuss their needs and preferences. For Stark Equipment, we spent time talking about their target audience, the type of products they offer, and how to convey their expertise in the industrial equipment industry.
- **Wireframing & Mockups**: Once I understood the client’s vision, I started by wireframing the website’s layout, focusing on user experience (UX) and how to present their products in an organized and clear way. Afterward, I created mockups that brought the design to life.
- **Building the Site**: The website was built with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I ensured it was responsive, allowing customers to easily view the site on desktop or mobile devices. The focus was on creating clear navigation, showcasing equipment features, and providing straightforward ways for potential customers to reach out.

### User-Focused Design

- **Product Showcase**: Stark Equipment’s website needed to highlight various industrial products, which required careful thought around layout, product descriptions, and images. I designed the product pages to be clean and informative, allowing customers to easily understand what was offered.
- **Contact Forms**: A key feature was a contact form that allowed potential customers to easily inquire about equipment or request a quote. It was important to ensure this was straightforward and easy to access from any page.
- **Responsiveness & Performance**: The site was designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring fast load times and a smooth experience for customers browsing on phones or tablets.

### Client's Vision & Updates

Since this is an older example, the site may have received some feature updates from the owner, but the core design remains true to the initial vision. It was fulfilling to see the site serve its purpose as a professional storefront, helping the business connect with customers and promote their products.

I thoroughly enjoy the process of meeting with clients, listening to their needs, and interpreting their vision into a design that works for them. The Stark Equipment website was a great example of that process and remains one of my early projects that I’m proud of. It's a testament to my ability to develop functional, aesthetically pleasing websites that serve both business goals and customer needs.
