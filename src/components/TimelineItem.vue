      The early days: 1990s - 2000s
    </h4>
    <p>
      Ah, the 1990s—a time when grunge was king, cassettes and floppy disks ruled supreme, and the internet was still wearing diapers. I spent my days in school, eventually making my way to college as the decade wrapped up, and my nights were filled with a deep love for graphic arts. Inspired by the vibrant worlds of Nintendo games and comic books, I dove headfirst into Photoshop and Illustrator, crafting questionable logos, chaotic gradients, and enough clip art to crash a printer.

      Then, one day, I stumbled upon the internet—this dazzling, pixelated frontier that felt like crossing an event horizon into the future. Suddenly, graphic design wasn’t enough. Enter Macromedia Studio: Dreamweaver, Flash, and Fireworks became my new tools of the trade. I built websites with spinning logos, animated buttons, and marquee text that screamed, “Welcome to 1999!” Flash was my muse—I was convinced it could make any website a masterpiece, as long as visitors didn’t mind waiting five minutes for it to load.
